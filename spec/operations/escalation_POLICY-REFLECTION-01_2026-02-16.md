# Escalation: POLICY-REFLECTION-01

**From:** Executive Assistant  
**To:** Technical Lead  
**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Reason:** user requested formal tasking to reflect changed policies in project artifacts.

## Request

Please open and execute a TL dispatch for policy alignment after recent updates:
- secret handling now permits approved OS secret store (macOS Keychain) in addition to environment variables;
- on-demand sync operation must be reflected in runtime/runbook language without weakening security boundaries.

## Required TL action

1. Create lane-based tasking and owners.
2. Ensure coverage of policy docs, role skills, templates, and runbooks.
3. Collect quality and verification evidence.
4. Publish acceptance ledger and push accepted scope.
